Synchrotron data

Problem: Limited hours for the current data analysis

PAyment based on certain partner conditions


1. Talking to the companies
2. Segmentation is crucial
3. Compose structure of fiber composites
   1. Hepoxis
   2. Fiber bundles
   3. Air bubbles
4. Cylinder shape (reconstructed in 3D), the entire data are a square but the actual data will be a cylinder.
5. Seperate the air bubbles from the rest of the fiber matrix
   1. size deviation, etc.
6. 1.7 x nano, tiff approx 40 MB, approx 3.000 x 5.000 in size
