## Why "A 3D Biomedical Segmentation Hub"?

This collection comprises papers and resources tailored for an internal project at the Alexandra Institute. Upon reassessment of its potential industry value, we've opted to open-source it, ensuring accessibility for all. The repository will remain actively maintained throughout the project's duration, continually updated with the latest advancements in the field, as time permits based on the priority of other projects.

### Motivation

Recent advancements in computer vision and artificial intelligence have propelled the development of foundational models, marking a significant stride towards creating versatile models with remarkable accuracy in zero-shot tasks. These models exhibit proficiency in various computer vision tasks, including depth estimation, object detection, and segmentation of unseen objects during training. However, despite their efficacy, current generic segmentation models often overlook highly dimensional data types such as synchrotron and electron microscopy data, due to their availability. This project is motivated by the need to explore the effectiveness of current segmentation solutions, both generic and specialized, in handling synchrotron and electron microscopy data for the task of interactive 3D segmentation. We deem this exploration essential, as the performance of existing models on such data types remains inadequately investigated.

#### Keypoints

- Explore effectiveness of current segmentation solutions for synchrotron and electron microscopy data.
- Investigate performance of existing models on such data types for interactive 3D segmentation.

> **Note:** In the 'basics' section, you'll find essential information to enhance your understanding of 3D interactive segmentation. This includes concise descriptions, examples, visualizations, and additional sources for further reading related to 3D interactive and semi-automatic segmentation of volumetric data, including synchrotron and microscopy data.
